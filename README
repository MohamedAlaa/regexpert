Regexpert
=========

Regexpert is an attempt to remove the need to worry about which regular expression to use for validating an email, a postcode, or a social security number.
Its inspired by the django.contrib.localflavor libraries and Datamapper dm-more's dm-validations module.

Example
=======

Instead of googling "email regexp", and then coming up with numerous arguments about the right regexp to use,
just use Regexpert

  validates_format_of :email, :with => Regexpert::Format::EmailAddress

BOOM!!!
no work, no worries.
